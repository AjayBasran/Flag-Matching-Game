# Flag-matching-game
Match flags to their respective country name. Implemented in HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript.

Developed a simple game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript that requires users to drag and drop flags to their respective country name. After matching the 3 flags correctly, a popup shows stating theyv'e won the game. Refreshing the tab, reloads the game.

This tested my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as allowed me to showcase the skillset that I have developed thus far.

The reason for this game in particular is because I am currently learning the names of each respective country with the goal of learning the flags as well. From this, I decided to get started to learn the flags of most of the countries in North and South America. The result is this game.
